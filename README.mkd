CanadaRox's Dotfiles
====================

Just a way to sync all of my critical configurations between mulptiple computers.

Using Files
-----------
On Linux I create with ln -s and link _file to ~/.file.
On Windows I source/include/import/etc the repo versions from the normal versions.

Screenshots
